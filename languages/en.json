        "p2": "If you haven't heard about the 42 network already, it's basically a network of campuses all around the world that aim to train the future of software engineers, using a very unique pedagogical approach based on peer-learning.",
        "p3": "I started programming about one year before I decided to attempt the selection of 42 Paris which took place in August of 2020. Since then, I basically never stopped, growing my skills and mindset, enjoying programming as a hobby, but also as a full-time activity.",
        "p4": "About programming in general, I'm mostly studying fundamentals at 42, making use of mainly C, C++ and even assembly. I also particularily like DevOps: deployment of containerized applications in the cloud, continuous integration... For example, I have setup a bunch of micro-services at home to handle the management of my passwords (Bitwarden), files (Nextcloud) and git repositories (Gitea). I also used these precious skills to deploy my personal projects with ease.",
        "p5": "I decided to specialize in web development, since the web is where most of the things happen nowadays. I started building solid front-end skills in order to make the website I had ever wanted, and then learned more advanced tools as well as back-end development. My web skills, although perfectible, form the core of my programming experience.",
        "p6": "Moreover, I'm really interested into the Linux ecosystem, and love hearing about open source software: I'm indeed using Linux as my daily driver since almost the beginning of my programming journey! After I tried out many (too much!) distributions, I finally decided to stay with my two favorites: Gentoo and Arch Linux. In connection with my DevOps experience, I'm also quite comfortable with every Debian-based distribution such as Ubuntu or Debian itself. I'm also a proud VIM user!",
        "p7": "My so-called life plan is to continue working on software engineering projects, while traveling the world (the dream of every software engineer, yes I know!). As computer science is also my passion, I don't mind working from the beach 😎",

        "cta": "Want to work with me?"
