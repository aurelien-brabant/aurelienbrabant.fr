    "p2": "If you haven't heard about the 42 network already, it's basically a network of campuses all around the world that aim to train the future of software engineers, using a very unique pedagogical approach based on peer-learning",
    "p3": "I started programming about one year before I decided to attempt the selection of 42 Paris which took place in August of 2020. Since then, I basically never stopped, growing my skills and mindset, enjoying programming as a hobby, but also as a full-time activity.",
    "p4": "About programming in general, I'm mostly studying fundamentals at 42, making use of mainly C, C++ and even assembly. Nonetheless, I'm also really interested in web development, especially in TypeScript and NodeJS, which this website is made out of!",
    "p5": "Moreover, I enjoy quite a lot the GNU/Linux ecosystem, and love hearing about open source software: I'm indeed using Linux as my daily driver since almost the beginning of my programming journey!",
    "p6": "My so-called life plan is to continue working on software engineering projects, while traveling the world (the dream of every software engineer, yes I know!)"
